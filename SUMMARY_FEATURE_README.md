### 3. LaTeX Math Support

#### Inline Math
Wrap formulas in single dollar signs: `$E = mc^2$`

Example:
```
The formula for energy is $E = mc^2$ where c is the speed of light.
```

#### Block Math
Wrap formulas in double dollar signs for display equations: `$$formula$$`

Example:
```
The quadratic formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
```

#### Supported LaTeX Features
- Fractions: `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`
- Superscripts: `x^2` or `x^{2n}`
- Subscripts: `x_1` or `x_{i,j}`
- Greek letters: `\alpha`, `\beta`, `\gamma`, etc.
- Integrals: `\int`, `\int_0^1`
- Sums: `\sum_{i=1}^n`
- Matrices: `\begin{pmatrix} ... \end{pmatrix}`
- And much more!

### 4. Auto-Save Functionality
- Automatically saves changes after 2 seconds of inactivity
- Visual feedback showing save status
- Last saved timestamp displayed

### 5. Document Integration
The summary intelligently references:
- Voice recordings: "As mentioned in the lecture..."
- Slides: "According to the slides..."
- Documents: "From the uploaded materials..."

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Summary

1. **Upload Documents** (voice, slides, PDFs, etc.)
2. **Navigate to Summary View** - Click on the summary tab
3. **Generate Summary** - Click "Generate Summary" button
4. **AI Processing** - The system analyzes all documents and creates a comprehensive summary
5. **Review and Edit** - Use the rich text editor to refine the summary

### Editing the Summary

#### Inline Editing
- Click anywhere in the text to start editing
- No need to click text fields - just click and type
- The entire editor acts as one continuous text field

#### Formatting
1. **Select text** you want to format
2. **Use toolbar buttons**:
   - Bold, Italic, Underline for emphasis
   - Heading dropdown for structure
   - Highlight color picker for important sections
   - Lists for organized content

#### Adding Math
1. Type your formula in LaTeX syntax
2. Wrap inline math with `$...$`
3. Wrap block math with `$$...$$`
4. Formulas automatically render

#### Adding Tables
1. Click the table button in toolbar
2. Creates a 3x3 table with header row
3. Use the toolbar to add rows/columns
4. Click the X button to delete table

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Upload Related Materials Together**
   - Upload voice recordings with their corresponding slides
   - The system will intelligently combine them

2. **Review the Generated Summary**
   - Check that all important concepts are included
   - Use the edit capabilities to add your own insights

3. **Use Formatting Wisely**
   - Use H1 for main topics
   - Use H2/H3 for subtopics
   - Highlight key terms
   - Use color strategically (not too much!)

4. **Cite Sources**
   - When editing, add citations like "According to the lecture..."
   - Helps with attribution and clarity

5. **Mathematical Content**
   - Use LaTeX for all math notation
   - Block math ($$) for display equations
   - Inline math ($) for formulas in text

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TipTap editor
- **Backend**: OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent summarization
- **Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage
- **LaTeX Rendering**: KaTeX for client-side math rendering

### Data Flow
1. User uploads documents → stored in Supabase
2. Documents processed → content extracted
3. Summary service analyzes document relationships
4. AI generates comprehensive summary
5. Summary stored in `study_content` table
6. User edits in rich text editor
7. Auto-save updates database

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE study_content (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  note_id UUID REFERENCES notes(id),
  summary TEXT,           -- Rich HTML content
  flashcards JSONB,
  quiz_questions JSONB,
  exercises JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Combining Audio + Slides
**Input:**
- Audio: Lecture recording discussing derivatives
- Slides: PDF with formulas and graphs

**Output:**
```markdown
# Introduction to Derivatives

## Overview
Derivatives are fundamental to calculus, representing the rate of change 
of a function. As mentioned in the lecture, they have numerous real-world 
applications in physics, economics, and engineering.

## Key Formula
From the slides, we have:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

## Applications
According to the lecture, derivatives are used in...
```

### Example 2: LaTeX Formulas
```
The quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has solutions:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

For the specific case where $a=1$:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}$$
```

## Troubleshooting

### Summary is too short
- Upload more related documents
- The summary adapts to available content
- Use the regenerate button to try again

### LaTeX not rendering
- Check syntax (matching `$` or `$$`)
- Ensure no extra spaces
- View browser console for errors

### Auto-save not working
- Check network connection
- Verify Supabase credentials
- Check browser console for errors

## Future Enhancements
- Drag and drop images
- Collaborative editing
- Version history
- Export to PDF/Word
- More LaTeX packages
- Handwriting recognition
