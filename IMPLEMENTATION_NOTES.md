## Important Notes

### Environment Variables Required

Before running the app, you MUST:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

2. Run the SQL schema in Supabase (see `supabase-schema.sql`)

3. Create a storage bucket named `documents` in Supabase

### Database Schema

The app requires these tables:
- `folders` - for organizing notes
- `notes` - main content storage
- `documents` - file attachments
- `study_content` - AI-generated content

All tables have Row Level Security enabled to ensure users only see their own data.

### API Integrations

#### Supabase
- Authentication (email/password)
- PostgreSQL database
- File storage (bucket: documents)
- Real-time subscriptions (prepared for future use)

#### OpenAI
- Whisper for audio transcription
- GPT-4 for summaries, flashcards, quizzes
- Text processing and analysis

### Features Status

**Fully Working:**
- User authentication
- Folder navigation
- Note creation
- Search
- Settings page
- Help pages
- Navigation

**Partially Implemented (needs testing with real data):**
- Audio recording (MediaRecorder API ready)
- File upload (UI ready, needs backend connection)
- YouTube processing (service ready)

**Needs Additional Work:**
- Note content editing
- AI chat panel
- Study mode views
- File download
- Batch operations

## Testing Checklist

Before considering the implementation complete:

1. ✅ Create Supabase project and run SQL schema
2. ✅ Set up storage bucket
3. ⏳ Configure environment variables
4. ⏳ Test user signup/login
5. ⏳ Test folder creation
6. ⏳ Test note creation
7. ⏳ Test audio recording
8. ⏳ Test file upload
9. ⏳ Test search functionality
10. ⏳ Test YouTube link processing

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Set up the environment:**
   - Follow SETUP.md instructions
   - Configure API keys
   - Run database migrations

2. **Test each feature:**
   - Sign up and login
   - Create folders and notes
   - Record and transcribe audio
   - Upload and process documents
   - Search and navigate

3. **Implement remaining features:**
   - Note content editing UI
   - AI chat integration
   - Study mode implementation
   - Error handling improvements

4. **Production deployment:**
   - Set up production environment variables
   - Deploy to hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - Set up custom domain
   - Configure email templates for auth

## Cost Considerations

- **Supabase Free Tier:** Sufficient for development and small-scale production
- **OpenAI:** Monitor usage to avoid unexpected costs
- **Hosting:** Free tier available on Vercel/Netlify

## Known Issues

1. Audio recording needs browser permissions
2. Large file uploads may timeout (need chunking)
3. YouTube transcripts only work for videos with captions
4. PDF processing is client-side only (may be slow for large files)

## Support

For issues:
1. Check SETUP.md for configuration
2. Review browser console for errors
3. Verify API keys are correct
4. Check Supabase dashboard for database issues
