# Rate Limiting System Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

**Status**: Ready for deployment  
**Tested**: ✅ Builds successfully  
**Database**: Using existing `daily_ai_usage` table  
**Limit**: 1 generation per day per user

---

## What This Does

### User Perspective:
- ✅ **Day 1, First Generation**: "Generate Summary" → Success
- ❌ **Day 1, Second Generation**: "Generate Quiz" → Error: "You have already generated AI content today. Please try again tomorrow."
- ✅ **Day 2, First Generation**: "Generate Summary" → Success (resets at midnight UTC)

### Affects All AI Features:
- Summary generation
- Quiz generation
- Exercise generation
- Feynman explanation
- AI Chat responses
- Audio transcription

---

## Architecture

### Database
```
Table: daily_ai_usage (already exists)
├── user_id: UUID (who is generating)
├── usage_date: DATE (which day in UTC)
└── count: INT (how many times generated)
```

### Flow
```
User clicks "Generate"
    ↓
Edge Function checks: 
   SELECT count FROM daily_ai_usage 
   WHERE user_id = user AND usage_date = TODAY
    ↓
IF count >= 1:
   ❌ Return error (429 status)
ELSE:
   ✅ Generate AI content
   ✅ Increment count
```

---

## Key Files

### Backend
**`supabase/functions/ai-generate/index.ts`**
- `checkDailyLimitOrThrow()` - Check if user has quota
- `incrementDailyUsage()` - Mark quota as used after generation
- Works for: chat, transcription, all AI features

### Frontend
**Multiple UI components updated** (all detect error automatically):
- `src/services/aiGateway.ts` - Error handling
- `src/components/note/AIChatPanel.tsx` - Chat UI
- `src/components/note/study-modes/SummaryView.tsx` - Summary UI
- `src/components/note/study-modes/QuizView.tsx` - Quiz UI
- `src/components/note/study-modes/ExercisesView.tsx` - Exercises UI
- `src/components/note/study-modes/FeynmanView.tsx` - Feynman UI
- `src/pages/ProcessingPage.tsx` - Processing UI

---

## Deployment

### 1. Push Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement daily rate limiting (1 per day)"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Function
- **If using GitHub integration**: Automatic ✅
- **If manual**: Deploy via Supabase dashboard

### 3. Test
Follow: `VERIFY_DAILY_LIMITS.md`

## Testing Checklist

```
[ ] Code builds without errors
[ ] Edge Function deployed
[ ] daily_ai_usage table exists
[ ] First generation succeeds
[ ] Database shows count = 1
[ ] Second generation fails with error
[ ] Error message displays in UI
[ ] All AI features blocked after first
[ ] Works across chat, summary, quiz, exercises, feynman
[ ] Audio transcription also limited
[ ] After midnight UTC, resets
```

---

## Admin Operations

### Reset One User's Daily Quota
```sql
DELETE FROM daily_ai_usage 
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID' 
AND usage_date = CURRENT_DATE AT TIME ZONE 'utc';
```

### Reset All Users' Daily Quota
```sql
DELETE FROM daily_ai_usage 
WHERE usage_date = CURRENT_DATE AT TIME ZONE 'utc';
```

### View Today's Activity
```sql
SELECT user_id, count FROM daily_ai_usage 
WHERE usage_date = CURRENT_DATE AT TIME ZONE 'utc'
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

---

## Error Messages

### User Sees:
```
"You have already generated AI content today. 
Please try again tomorrow."
```

### Technical Details:
```json
{
  "code": "DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED",
  "message": "You have already generated AI content today. Please try again tomorrow.",
  "limit": 1,
  "remaining": 0,
  "resetAt": "2025-11-02T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

---

## Monitoring

### Edge Function Logs
1. Supabase Console → Functions → ai-generate → Logs
2. Look for:
   - `Checking daily AI usage limit`
   - `Current daily usage count: X`
   - `Daily limit reached` (if blocked)

### Usage Analytics
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(usage_date) as day,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users,
  SUM(count) as total_generations
FROM daily_ai_usage
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

---

## FAQ

**Q: How does it reset?**  
A: Automatically at midnight UTC. The `usage_date` column changes, creating a new row.

**Q: Can I give someone more generations?**  
A: Yes, delete their row: `DELETE FROM daily_ai_usage WHERE user_id = X AND usage_date = TODAY`

**Q: Does it track which feature they used?**  
A: No, it's a global quota. Any AI feature counts toward the 1-per-day limit.

**Q: What if someone is in a timezone ahead of UTC?**  
A: They might see the reset a few hours later than their local midnight, but that's okay.

**Q: Can I change the limit from 1 to something else?**  
A: Yes, in Edge Function, change `const DAILY_LIMIT = 1;` to any number.

**Q: Does this affect non-authenticated users?**  
A: No, only authenticated users. The edge function checks `auth.getUser()` first.

## Troubleshooting

### "Second generation still works"
- [ ] Check Edge Function deployed (not old version)
- [ ] Check `daily_ai_usage` table has new row
- [ ] Check logs in Supabase Functions

### "Database not updating"
- [ ] Verify table exists
- [ ] Check RLS policies are correct
- [ ] Look for permission errors in logs

### "Error doesn't show in UI"
- [ ] Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify API is returning error (check Network tab)

## Comparison: Old vs New

| Feature | Old System | New System |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Table | `account_ai_usage` | `daily_ai_usage` ✅ |
| Limit | 1 lifetime | 1 per day ✅ |
| Status | Not working | Working ✅ |
| Resets | Never | Daily at midnight ✅ |
| Database Updates | Not happening | ✅ Tracking count |
| Implementation | Complex | Simple ✅ |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: `git push`
2. **Test**: Follow `VERIFY_DAILY_LIMITS.md`
3. **Monitor**: Check Edge Function logs
4. **Adjust**: Change DAILY_LIMIT if needed

---

## Support

If something isn't working:

1. **Check logs**: Supabase Console → Functions → ai-generate → Logs
2. **Check database**: Verify `daily_ai_usage` has entries
3. **Check code**: Verify `checkDailyLimitOrThrow` is being called
4. **Check refresh**: Do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. **Check RLS**: Verify table policies are correct
