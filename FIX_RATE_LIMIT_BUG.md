# 🐛 Rate Limit Bug Fix

## The Bug

**Symptom**: First generation works, but second generation ALSO works even though count = 1

**Root Cause**: The `checkDailyLimitOrThrow()` function was using an upsert that reset the count!

```typescript
// BROKEN CODE:
.upsert({ user_id: userId, usage_date: usageDate, count: 0 }, { onConflict: 'user_id,usage_date' })
```

**What happened:**
1. First generation: Row doesn't exist
   - Upsert inserts new row with count = 0 ✅
   - Check passes (count < 1)
   - After generation, incrementDailyUsage sets count = 1 ✅

2. Second generation: Row exists with count = 1
   - Upsert UPDATES the row, setting count back to 0! ❌❌❌
   - Check passes (count = 0, limit not reached) ❌
   - Generation proceeds (should have been blocked!)
   - incrementDailyUsage sets count = 1 again

**The Problem**: Every check was resetting the count to 0!

---

## The Fix

Changed the approach to:
1. **SELECT first** - Check if row exists WITHOUT modifying anything
2. **INSERT only if missing** - Only create row if it doesn't exist
3. **NEVER reset count on check** - The check function only reads, never writes to existing rows

```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
// Try to fetch count (no modifications)
const { data: existingRow, error: selectError } = await supabase
  .from('daily_ai_usage')
  .select('count')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .eq('usage_date', usageDate)
  .single();

// If row doesn't exist, INSERT it (and only then)
if (selectError && selectError.code === 'PGRST116') {
  const { error: insertError } = await supabase
    .from('daily_ai_usage')
    .insert({ user_id: userId, usage_date: usageDate, count: 0 });
  // Return - count is 0, no limit reached
  return null;
}

// Row exists - check the count (which hasn't been touched)
const currentCount = existingRow?.count ?? 0;
if (currentCount >= 1) {
  return Response(429 error);  // Block!
}

return null; // Allow
```

## Verification

### Expected Behavior Now:

**First Generation:**
```
Check: SELECT count → No row exists
Action: INSERT row with count = 0
Check: count (0) < 1 → Allow ✅
Generation: Proceeds
After: UPDATE count = 1
Database: { count: 1 }
```

**Second Generation Same Day:**
```
Check: SELECT count → Row exists with count = 1
Action: Don't modify anything!
Check: count (1) >= 1 → Block ❌
Response: HTTP 429 error
User sees: "You have already generated AI content today..."
Database: { count: 1 } (unchanged)
```

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Deploy
```bash
git push
```

### Step 2: Test First Generation
1. Log in
2. Click "Generate Summary"
3. Should succeed ✅

### Step 3: Check Database
```sql
SELECT * FROM daily_ai_usage 
WHERE user_id = '231217f7-d29d-4c91-a6e8-1e39d5b70b83'
AND usage_date = CURRENT_DATE AT TIME ZONE 'utc';
```
Should show: `count: 1` ✅

### Step 4: Test Second Generation
1. Click "Generate Quiz" (any AI feature)
2. Should fail with error ❌
3. Error: "You have already generated AI content today. Please try again tomorrow."

### Step 5: Verify Edge Function Logs
Supabase → Functions → ai-generate → Logs

**First generation logs:**
```
Checking daily AI usage limit for user: 231217f7...
No existing row, creating new one for user: 231217f7...
No limit reached for user: 231217f7..., proceeding with generation
```

**Second generation logs:**
```
Checking daily AI usage limit for user: 231217f7...
Current daily usage count: 1
Daily limit reached for user: 231217f7...
```

## Key Difference: Before vs After

### Before (Broken):
```
check() → upsert (resets to 0) → select (always sees 0) → always passes
✅ Gen1: Works
✅ Gen2: Still works (BUG!)
✅ Gen3: Still works (BUG!)
```

### After (Fixed):
```
check() → select only → count correctly preserved → check passed/blocked correctly
✅ Gen1: Works (count = 1)
❌ Gen2: Blocked (count = 1)
❌ Gen3: Blocked (count = 1)
✅ Gen1 tomorrow: Works (new row, count = 1)
```

## What Was Changed

File: `supabase/functions/ai-generate/index.ts`

Function: `checkDailyLimitOrThrow()`

**Change:** 
- Removed the problematic upsert that was resetting count
- Changed to: SELECT first, INSERT only if missing
- Preserves existing count values
- Only reads on check, never writes to existing rows
