# React Learning Notes - Setup Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up the React Learning Notes app with Supabase and OpenAI integration.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm installed
- A Supabase account (free tier is sufficient)
- An OpenAI API key

## Step 1: Set Up Supabase

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Note down your project URL and anon key from Settings > API
3. In the Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
5. Run the SQL script to create all necessary tables and policies

## Step 2: Set Up Storage

1. In Supabase, go to Storage
2. Create a new bucket called `documents`
3. Make it private (not public)
4. Set up the following policies:
   - INSERT: `auth.uid() = user_id`
   - SELECT: `auth.uid() = user_id`
   - UPDATE: `auth.uid() = user_id`
   - DELETE: `auth.uid() = user_id`

## Step 3: Get API Keys

### Supabase
1. Go to your project settings
2. Copy the Project URL
3. Copy the Anon/public key (under API keys)

### OpenAI
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Navigate to API keys
3. Create a new secret key
4. Copy the key (you won't be able to see it again!)

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and add your credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

**Important:** Never commit the `.env` file to version control!

## Step 5: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 6: Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`

## Step 7: Create Your First Account

1. The app will redirect you to the login page
2. Click on "Sign Up" to create a new account
3. You'll receive an email confirmation
4. Once logged in, you can start creating notes!
